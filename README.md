## Help&Tech
A socio-technological venture where a team of computer science students build a technology product for a non-profit organization that can't afford to hire developers.
The project involved the entire process from product specification to programming it. 
I developed the most with React.js and used open source code.

## Reflection
This project gave me an amazing opportunity to learn about the process of a product.
From the meetings with the company and clarifying their needs, to specify the product and challange of programming it.
With the fact that we're still students, I learned a lot about teamwork and the importance of the tasks deadlines and time-managment.
I also realized how big the open source community is, and how powerful is it to create something so fast, with the right to user other's genius code.

#### Project Status
This project is currently on freeze due to logistic issues.
