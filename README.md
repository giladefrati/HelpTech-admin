## Help&Tech Project Background
A socio-technological venture where a team of computer science students build a technology product for a non-profit organization that can't afford to hire developers.
The project involved the entire process from product specification to actually programming it. 
I developed the most with React.js and used open source code, while the other team used Node.js and more.

## The CRM
A CRM administrator with the purpose of managing candidates through thier process in the bootcamp stages.
The CRM devided into pages, where every page is a different stage of the program, and fliters the candidates accordingly.

## Reflection
This project gave me an amazing opportunity to learn about the process of building a product.
From the meetings with the company and clarifying their needs, to specify the product and the challange of programming it.
With the fact that we're still students, I learned a lot about teamwork and the importance of the tasks deadlines and time-managment.
I also realized how big the open source community is, and how powerful is it to create something so fast, with the right to user other's genius code.
